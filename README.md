This project is a game that involves auditory and visual stimulations meant to provide a de-stressing experience for stressed office workers and professionals.
This is a music game which uses a variety of inputs such as traditional computer inputs (keyboard, mouse) and soothing music and visuals to calm individuals and invoke a sense of relaxation through immersive  and calming gameplay.
The gameplay is simple to learn for everyone to maximize interactivity while minimizing stress. It uses a combination of both psychedelic and music therapy to achieve our project goal and offer a simple game that will help others to improve their mental state.
