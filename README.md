This project is a virtual reality game involving auditory and visual stimulations to provide a de-stressing experience for stressed industry professionals.
This is an interactive music visualization game which uses a variety of inputs such as traditional computer inputs (keyboard, mouse) or virtual reality controls (motion controller) and soothing music and visuals to calm individuals and invoke a sense of relaxation through experiential immersion.
The gameplay is simple to learn for everyone to maximize interactivity while minimizing stress. It uses a combination of both psychedelic and music therapy to achieve our project goal and offer a simple game that will help others to improve their mental state.
